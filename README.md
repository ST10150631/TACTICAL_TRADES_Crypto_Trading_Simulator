Tactical trades have many features to improve user experience such as colourblind graph filters, user-friendly interfaces, news feeds and advanced analytical data to ensure that the user has access to all the data possible to make informed trades. The app will also have difficulty selections allowing users to select their starting amount and will have goals the user can achieve.

### Utilization of Github
By using github we were able to peform version control. This allowed us to be able to track changes that were made to the application as well as allowing for collaboration between group members. Github increased the speed of the developement process as each member were able to work on each of the features seperately and this prevented team members from working on the same feature as the project manager assigned each group member a feature.

---

### Utilization of Github Actions

In the development of Tactical Trades, we utilized GitHub Actions to streamline our testing process and ensure continuous integration. GitHub Actions was configured to automatically run our suite of tests each time code was pushed to the repository, allowing us to quickly identify and resolve any issues that might impact functionality. By automating these tests, we maintained code reliability and minimized potential errors before they reached the app’s build. This integration significantly enhanced our workflow by providing instant feedback on code changes, helping us uphold the app’s stability and performance throughout development

---
### Purpose of the Application
The purpose of Tactical Trades is to provide a safe, realistic environment for users to learn and practice cryptocurrency trading without financial risk. By leveraging real-time data through Coin API, the app aims to simulate the experience of trading on major platforms, equipping users with essential insights and data for making informed trades. Tactical Trades is designed for accessibility and learning, with features like colorblind-friendly graphs, intuitive interfaces, and advanced analytical tools to deepen users’ understanding of market trends. With customizable difficulty settings and achievable trading goals, the app serves as an engaging educational tool for both beginners and seasoned enthusiasts looking to refine their trading strategies.

### Design Considerations
#### The Design considerations are as follows:
- Ensured that the interface was user-friendly. This was achieved by making the user-interface as simple as possible and did not have to many events occuring at once that would overwhelm the users.
- Ensured that the application displayed the user with a News Feed as well as advanced analytical data so that the users is able to make informed trades.
- Used a Model-View-Control Design Architecture to ensure that the application is seperated into three interconnected components. By doing this it ensured that our code was organized, easy to manage and test. It also allowed us to be able to develop each independent component.
- Ensured that the application had a navigation bar so that the user is able to navigate to each screen easily.
- Ensured that a Firebase database was created and implemented into the application so that accounts and user data can be stored.
- Ensured that the app displayed the user with responses when an action was performed.This allows the user to be informed when an action is either successful or failed.
- Made sure that the application had a finger print scanner to ensure that the correct user was accessing the account and not a threat agent.
- Allowed for the user to be able to change their profile picture.
- The user is able to view their balance on every screen.
- The application allows for the user to change the language from english to afrikaans.
- The user is able to change their username and password.
- The user is able to change the theme of their application.
- Application has a leaderboard function that ranks each user by how much money they have made through trading.

## AI Usage Writeup 
Use of AI in development:
GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT were two AI tools that were very helpful in debugging and improving the code as it was being developed. Copilot offered solutions and code recommendations for typical coding problems.
When some features did not work as intended, ChatGPT helped with more thorough troubleshooting by assisting in the identification and resolution of particular coding problems.
ChatGPT offers multiple processes and apporaches to solving a problem which helps to save time in debigging the errors. 

AI use Acknowledgement and Citations:
As part of our development process, AI technologies were cited in line with academic honesty and transparency. While ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot offered assistance with debugging and code recommendations, they were not responsible for any of the fundamental choices regarding functionality, architecture, or design. The team examined and modified any code changes or recommendations from Copilot and ChatGPT as needed to meet the project's particular needs. This strategy made sure that, even while AI technologies increased productivity, Tactical Trades' main design and logic components were still the result of the team's autonomous labor.
